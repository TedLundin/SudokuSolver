# SudokuSolver

## Project
This project was designed to test the efficacy of three differing types of artificial intelligence algorithms for solving Sudoku Puzzles. The three algorithms the program uses to solve puzzles are a backtracking algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and a constraint propagation algorithm.
### Files
#### Cell.h & Cell.cpp
These files create a class called Cell which represents a single tile within a Sudoku puzzle.
#### SudokuPuzzle.h & SudokuPuzzle.cpp
These files create a class called SudokuPuzzle which is how all our puzzles will be represented. 
#### Backtrack.h & Backtrack.cpp
These files implement the backtracking algorithm.
#### Constraint.h & Constraint.cpp
These files implement the constraint propagation algorithm
#### Genetic.h & Genetic.cpp
These files implement the genetic algorithm.
#### main.cpp
This is the file to run to see the algorithms in action.
